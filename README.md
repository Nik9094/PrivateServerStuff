# PrivateServerStuff
This plugin just handles a couple of things in my server.
Will never be advanced, modular or perhaps useful to someone else, but hey. Open source!

# Todo's
- Implement LuckPerms API, need to handle permissions without using the /lp user command
- Remove collision
- Make a smarter world loader/unloader using Multiverse-Core API
- - Possibly bound to Signs
