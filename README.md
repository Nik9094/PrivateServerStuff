# PrivateServerStuff
This Minecraft 1.12.2 paper plugin handles world loading/joining in my private server. It also has a few other utilities to make player experience smooth enough.
Will never be advanced, properly optimized or perhaps useful to someone else, but hey. Open source!

# Todo's
- Fix Multiverse-Core repo/dependency not working (not my problem??)
- Be better at Java
