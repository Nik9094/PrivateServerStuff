# PrivateServerStuff
This plugin handles world loading/joining in my private server. It also has a few other utilities to make player experience smooth enough.
Will never be advanced, properly optimized or perhaps useful to someone else, but hey. Open source!

# Todo's
- Implement LuckPerms API, need to handle permissions without using the /lp user command
- Bind world loader to signs??
- Fix Multiverse-Core repo/dependency not working (not my problem??)
- Be better at Java
